How Zip works?
Archive unpacking and saving in App-working directory as a folder of archive content

How to use:
If your pictures are in folder use "Path to folder" (above the "Start" button) to write path to folder. Then press "Start"
If your pictures are in archive transfer archive to "File.zip" field and press "Start".

Wait until picture shows up.

You can use "→" and "←" buttons. 
DON'T USE "↑" and "↓" they turn off dashbord control!
If you are facing this problem you can press ">" "<" ">>" "<<" buttons to fix it.
